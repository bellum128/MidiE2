# Expression 2 MIDI Extension #

----------
## Information ##
This Wiremod Expression 2 extension allows the use of a connected MIDI controller inside of Expression 2. This can allow Expression 2 to act as an interface between a real life MIDI device and contraptions in Garry's Mod.

## Installation ##
- Server-side Dependencies
	- Wiremod 
- Client-side Dependencies
	- The GMCL MIDI module by FPtje. This can be found at [https://github.com/FPtje/gmcl_midi](https://github.com/FPtje/gmcl_midi "https://github.com/FPtje/gmcl_midi")

Simply merge the `lua` folder of the extension with the server-side Garry's Mod Wiremod addon folder, and enable the extension with `wire_expression2_extension_enable midi`.

I would like to give a big thanks to Falco Peijnenburg ([FPtje](https://github.com/FPtje "FPtje")) for creating the MIDI module that this extension wraps.
